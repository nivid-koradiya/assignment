Hello, 
# Nivid Koradiya here.

This is the submission regarding the internship assignment for django REST API.

Here I have developed an API for adding and reading the assignments in the database.

# Database Used == POSTGRESQL

DATABSE PASSWORD AND USERNAME EDITING FACILITY IN SETTINGS.py

This API can be tested using POSTMAN or the web-browser.

## Kindly install all required dependencies before testing the assignment. (from requirements.txt)
# testing paths : 

127.0.0.1:8000/task/all --GET REQUEST
127.0.0.1:8000/task/new --POST REQUEST
